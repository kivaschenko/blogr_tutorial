This module helps divide up large result sets into pages or chunks.
The user gets displayed one page at a time and can navigate to other pages.
It is especially useful when developing web interfaces and showing the
users only a selection of information at a time.

This module uses and extends the functionality of the paginate module to 
support SQLAlchemy queries.
